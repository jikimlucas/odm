OpenDroneMap

===

Projects like Google Streetview, Mapillary, PhotoSynth, and most small UAS (drone) postprocessing software, such as that offered by senseFly, share a commonality-- they all use computer vision techniques to create spatial data from un-referenced photography.

OpenDroneMap is an open source project to unlock and make easy-to-use related related computer vision techniques, so that whether from street level photos or from civilian drone imagery, the average user will be able to generate point clouds, 3D surfaces models, DEMs, and orthophotography from processing unreferenced photos.

The first step in ODM is to build the toolchain for processing data. Long term, the aim is to create an open repository for civilian drone and surface level data, in the spirit of OpenStreetMapâ€‹.
