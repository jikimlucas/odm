{"name":"OpenDroneMap","tagline":"Computer Vision for Easy Mapping","body":"### Welcome to OpenDroneMap.\r\nProjects like [Google Streetview](https://www.google.com/maps/views/home?hl=en&gl=us), [Mapillary](http://www.mapillary.com/), [PhotoSynth](https://www.photosynth.net/), and most small UAS (drone) postprocessing software, such as that offered by [senseFly](https://www.sensefly.com/) share a commonality-- they all use computer vision techniques to create spatial data from un-referenced photography.\r\n \r\nOpenDroneMap is an open source project to unlock and make easy-to-use related related computer vision techniques, so that whether from street level photos or from civilian drone imagery, the average user will be able to generate point clouds, 3D surfaces models, DEMs, and orthophotography from processing unreferenced photos.\r\n\r\nThe first step in ODM is to build the toolchain for processing data. Long term, the aim is to create an open repository for civilian drone and surface level data, in the spirit of OpenStreetMapâ€‹.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor the moment, OpenDroneMap will use an existing FOSS toolchain with [Bundler SfM](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/bundler/), [Patch-based Multi-view Stereo Software](http://www.di.ens.fr/pmvs/), [Clustering Views for Multi-view Stereo](http://www.di.ens.fr/cmvs/), and related tools. The aim will be to wrap this toolchain in a simple to use and easy to deploy web interface in order to bootstrap the project.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, the project may use more liberally licensed software, such as [Libmv](https://github.com/libmv/libmv).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\nCurrently the project is deployed using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) using a 64bit Ubuntu VM. To get running, install Vagrant and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Clone or download this repository. Navigate to the directory and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will take some time for the machine to download, compile, and install all the software. Directions on how to use are forthcoming.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
